# ArabicToRomanGUI
## Utilized Java Swing to create a graphic user interface to allow a user to to enter in a text box and translate Arabic numbers in to Roman numbers and vice versa.

# BouncingBalls
## Utlizied multi-threading to allow a ball to bounce around a graphic user interface. A thread serves as a ball. Right clicking should pause/start the ball.

# Computus
## Is a program ran in the terminal. This program can solve what day Easter is on any inputed year. This follows the computus formula.

# FileRetrieve
## Using Java's Socket Programming, two computers can communicate with each other and send files. A server needs to start and a user needs to connect to the host. A connection is made by setting the correct IP in the code.

# GraphAlgos
## This uses self implemented Depth First Search and Breadth First Search to construct an Adjacency list from a file of words. The Adjacency list or graph, is to be constructed by connecting words with similar features. Then the program finds the shortest path connecting all the words.

# MachineLearning (K Nearest Clustering)
## This algorithm sorts data from a file into two classes. It first imports the text file and parses the file to find the class of the file. Then it orders each class from greatest to least datapoints. 
## The user then inputs a datapoint and class, the algorithm then finds the closest datapoints specified by the user.

# MazeTraversal
## This program can traverse a 12x12 two-dimensional array that acts as a maze. '.' act as empty spaces and '#' acts as walls. '.' on the edge of the 2d array signifies the start or end.

# RequestInheritance
## These are a set of files that were simulated to be corrupted from an accident. Using the code's inheritance structure, it was possible to trace and fix the files.

#Thanksgiving
## This is a classic problem like the knapsack problem. We need to figure out the optimal 'happiness' a person will get with eating 'n' amount of food. Creating a ratio between how much a food fills the stomach
## the happiness a person gets, a greedy algorithm was used to find highest ratios until the stomach is filled.

#TicTacToe
## this allows a user to play against a computer bot, another person, or have a computer play a computer. When the user is playing tic tac toe, the user is playing it on the terminal.
